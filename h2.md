# H2 Kill Chain

## x)

- A new class of threat has appeared. Its intents are to compromise data for economic or military advancement. They have been given the moniker of "Advanced Persistent Threat" or APT for short. Regular threat protection agaisnt viruses or worms do not work on these kinds of manually operated APT attacks.
- There were multiple attacks on NASA and other US government networks where APT attacks went unnoticed and successfully removed important information for example on sensitive high-performance rocket design information.
- Kill chain describes the structure of the attack, and the model guides analysis to inform actionable security intelligence. It is meant so that the "defenders" can develop defences against these attacks and prioritize investments in further technologies or processes.
- Indicators. Indicators are one of the fundamental elements of an intrusion. Indicators can be subdivided into three types:
   - Atomic. These are indicators that cant be separated into smaller parts, such as IP addresses or email addresses
   - Computed. These indicators are derived from the data of the incident such as hash values.
   - Behavioral. These indicators are the collection of both atomic and computed indicators.
- The paper presents a new type of kill chain that is specifically made for intrusions.
- This kill chain has seven different phases which are:
   - Reconnaissance. It basically means the research, indentification and selection of what to target, such as scouring the web for email addresses or relationships.
   - Weaponization. Creating malicious payloads with PDF's or office documents.
   - Delivery. How the payload is then transmitted to the target environment. These can be through email, websites, or usb sticks.
   - Exploitation. Trigger the malicious payload.
   - Installation. Install backdoors into the victims systems.
   - Command and Control (C2). Intruder now gains access to the victims keyboard.
   - Actions on Objectives. Only now can the intruder actually access the victims assests and take control of them.
- The courses of action matrix wants you to use the following actions of detect, deny, disrupt, deceive, and destroy. It helps you to counterattack the attacker.
- Intelligence-driven computer netwrok defence is necessary in todays evergrowing threat advancements. Conventional defence methods are inadequate at stopping APT attacks.

## a)

- Tactic. It represents the "why" part of the ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the goal of the action. An example for a tactic could be Reconnaissance so the attacker is trying to get information they can use for their future operations.
- Techniques and subtechniques. Techniques are the "how" in the attack. So this could be the act of phishing, so sending out emails to get access to the victims systems. Subtechniques are more specific description of how they are going to attack. So this could be spearphishing attachments, where the attackers with emails that contain attachments that are used then to control the victims system.
- Procedures. They specific implementations that the attacker uses for techniques or subtechniques. For example APT sent spearphising emails that contain malicious pdf attachments.

- I successfully downloaded linux image on my laptop.
