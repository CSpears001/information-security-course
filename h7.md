### 2.3 One-way functions
- One-way function is a key part to public-key cryptography
- They are quite easy to commute but not to reverse
- It can be thought of like a plate is easy to break into a thousand pieces but those pieces are difficult to make back into a plate
- One-way functions cannot be used alone to encrypt as otherwise you couldnt decrypt the message
- Trapdoor one-way functions fix this problem by including a secret backdoor that allows decrypting

### 2.4 One-way hash functions
- One-way hash function is also central to modern cryptography
- They take an input of any length and the produce a fixed-length output so hash value.
- Message authentication code are one-way hash functions that include a secret key.

## a)
- Installing Hashcat onto the linux
- I started by updating my linux using the command sudo apt-get update

- After this I tried using the command sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget but that didnt work so I just used sudo apt-get install hashcat which worked

- After this I created the new directory with the command mkdir hashed and accessed it with cd hashed

- Then I downloaded the dictionary with the command wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
<img width="1152" height="447" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 191243" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2d5bee-b424-433a-8655-9d73696cde78" />
- Then I archived the xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz and removed rockyou.txt.tar.gz
<img width="496" height="42" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 191347" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64fe5428-3cc3-4172-828f-854be2916033" />
- Then I checked some of the first hashes with the command head rockyou.txt
<img width="463" height="214" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 191440" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97264579-b1fd-48e3-b6b8-a66a92788c64" />
- Then I checked the wordcount for the rockyou file
<img width="431" height="38" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 192013" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2031bec-e6dc-440f-80a0-4a52fd851164" />
- Then I cracked the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 with the command hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
<img width="1214" height="663" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 192323" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f21f22d-54bb-4da1-a117-563420dedfd6" />
<img width="1025" height="629" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 192334" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd554f1-1e72-4b23-a236-1f406a917d06" />
- Finally I used the command cat solved to show the password "summer"

## b)
- I first used the same command as in the a) task to crack the hash so but changed the hash to the one in the task hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
<img width="1275" height="570" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 192841" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4bc834-233c-4525-b71a-d69d90aaec86" />
<img width="952" height="612" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-05 192855" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e8a817e-c4b3-4668-b242-69cc65c83479" />
- The whole command took maybe a second to complete and I got the password disobey
