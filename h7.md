### 2.3 One-way functions
- One-way function is a key part to public-key cryptography
- They are quite easy to commute but not to reverse
- It can be thought of like a plate is easy to break into a thousand pieces but those pieces are difficult to make back into a plate
- One-way functions cannot be used alone to encrypt as otherwise you couldnt decrypt the message
- Trapdoor one-way functions fix this problem by including a secret backdoor that allows decrypting

### 2.4 One-way hash functions
- One-way hash function is also central to modern cryptography
- They take an input of any length and the produce a fixed-length output so hash value.
- Message authentication code are one-way hash functions that include a secret key.
