- OWASP A01.2021 - Broken Access Control.
  - Broken access control was tested by 94% of applications with 3.81% having some form of incident.
  - Access control in of itself enforces how many things users can access with their permissions.
  - Broken access controls lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of data.
  - It can be prevent via several methods but here are some: Deny all except public resources by default, Log access control failures and alert the admins about them, and limit the rate of API and controller access to minimize attacks from automated tools.

- OWASP A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
  - 90% of applications were tested for some sort of security misconfiguration with 4.51% having an incident.
  - An application can be vulnerable if for example they are missing the appropriate securtiy hardening accross any part of the applications stack or some improperly configured permissions within their cloud services.
  - The app can also be vulnerable if it has unnecessary features enabled or installed. Default accounts and passwords should be changed also as they are usually quite easy to get into.
  - Having out of date software is also a key liability.
  - Ways to prevent this kind of vulnerability are: Having a minimal platform without any unnecessary features of any kind, having an automated process that verifies effectiveness of the configurations and settings for all environments, and sending security directives to clients.
 
- OWASP A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - Vulnerable Components are a known issue that is always tested and risk assessed.
  - You might be vulnerable if: you do not knwo what versions all of your components are on be it client or server side, if your software is vulnerable, not supported, or out of date, this could be your OS or application, and if you dont scan for potential vulnerabilities.
  - Ways to prevent this: Remove all unused features, components, files, etc. Regularly keep track of what versions your components are using and if they need updates. Only obtain your components from official secured sources.
 
- OWASP A03:2021 - Injection
  - 94% of applications were tested with some sort of injection with a max incidence rate of 19% are average of 3%.
  - You can be vulnerable if: the supplied data by users is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application, or hostile data is directly used.
  - You can prevent injections by: using positive server-side input validation. Use a safe API that avoids using the interpreter and provides a parameterized interface.
 
- xkcd Exploits of a Mom
  - the name of the moms son is a sql injection attack that deletes the schools student database because their software isnt secure.

## a) 
- I successfully downloaded java and enable ufw on my debian.
- One thing I had to do is use java version 21.0.8 because for some reason I couldnt download the version 17. Shouldnt really matter though.

- After that I downloaded the webgoat and started it
