- I did all the commands from the command line basics task. The directions were quite simple to follow and I think I got the hang of most of them.

## a)
I tried pinging both Cloudfare and Google

## b)
I portscanned my own computer

## c)
I installed apache

I portscanned again with apache

The differences with apache installed and without is that it now opened the apache web server which is port 80.

## d)
I completed all levels 0-4
