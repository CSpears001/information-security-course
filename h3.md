# H3 Hello lab

## x)

- I successfully downloaded and installed Debian onto my laptop.
- Debian was easy enough to download through the given instructions

- I did all the commands from the command line basics task. The directions were quite simple to follow and I think I got the hang of most of them.
- You can do multiple tasks with simple commands in Linux.

## a)
I tried pinging both Cloudfare and Google. Both resulted in "Network is unreachable" as I was not connected to the internet.

## b)
I portscanned my own computer

Before portscanning do remember to download nmap with internet and then shut down your internet otherwise its a lot harder to portscan.

nmap was downloaded with the command "sudo apt install nmap"

## c)
I installed apache

You also need internet to download apache

It was done with the command "sudo apt install apache2"

I portscanned again with apache

The differences with apache installed and without is that it now opened the apache web server which is port 80.

## d)
I completed all levels 0-4
