- It is the idea of sending messages to another person without a third person or eavesdropper accessing that message in any way before the receiver.
- These messages are laid out in plaintext.
- Ciphertext is an encrypted message.
- Encryption is what makes plaintext into ciphertext
- The way of keeping messages secure is cryptography which is done by cryptographers.
- The art of breaking ciphertext is cryptanalysis which is done by cyptoanalysts.
- Authentication is the verification of the senders own indentity.
- Integrity means that the message should be the original one sent by the sender to the receiver and that has not been tampered with.
- Nonrepudiation means that the sender cant later falsely deny that he ever sent the message.
- There are two types of key-based algorithms. These being public-key and symmetric.
- In symmetric algorithms both the sender and the receiver share the same key.
- In a public-key algorithm you have a key pair, the public and private ones.
- Steganography is made to hide messages within other messages.
- Substitution ciphers are made to hide a message by replacing characters with other ones.
- Tranposition ciphers hide a message by mixing the order of the characters in the message.
- XOR seems to be quite easy to break since you can use plaintext ⊕ key = ciphertext but you can reverse this to be ciphertext ⊕ key = plaintext so it is really easy to decrypt a message if I understood correctly.
- One-Time Pads are a way of encrypting messages very securely. It creates truly random keys that are used once and then destroyed.

- PGP using gpg is a way of encrypting and signing messages.
- You need to generate a key pair. Public and secret.
- You need to send the public key to the person who wants to send you a message before they can send it.
- You need to verify that the public key is actual the public key of the person you want to send a message to.
- If now you want to send a message to another person you need their public key.

## a) 

- I started by opening terminal and first updating the linux with the command sudo apt-get update

- After updating the linux I went and started downloading the ssh onto my linux with the command sudo apt-get install ssh
<img width="1124" height="562" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175345" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4657aaa-229b-48bb-813f-1776b6ac0b17" />
- After installing the ssh I started it with the command sudo systemctl start ssh
<img width="504" height="42" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180014" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6cc8932-9d8b-47e9-9339-39b4f7d4da62" />
- After this I gave the command whoami to find my localhost
- After that I gave the command ssh chris@localhost to the terminal
<img width="880" height="181" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175444" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ef59b2-fdb9-485b-87de-097f62552d3f" />
<img width="914" height="447" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175502" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd14d4c1-69f0-4065-9e94-3dc47a4020bb" />
- I typed yes for both questions when they came up.
- After this I exited
<img width="713" height="236" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175516" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f26c11c-0dae-4c7a-a020-2b8f41cfde02" />

## b)

- I opened the ssh again with the command ssh chris@localhost
- After this I gave the command ssh-keygen
<img width="1001" height="456" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180504" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dba56f1-2940-4167-96fd-0368cd22e707" />
- It will ask you to give a passphrase but I just pressed enter to bypass that so that there is no passphrase. you need to press enter twice as it asks for it a second time.
- After that it gave me the key.
- Then after that I gave the command ssh-copy-id chris@localhost to give the public key to the ssh
<img width="1134" height="245" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180811" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/799cb7fb-fc36-4a4d-95c4-def30986c22e" />
- After that I exited and tried the command ssh chris@localhost and this time the ssh did not ask for my password anymore.
<img width="1110" height="288" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180945" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd8023d6-841c-42b8-8689-40e3581df78e" />

## c)

- I downloaded the Bitwarden password manager as it was rated as one of the best password managers.
<img width="1654" height="1224" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 200645" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3233ea03-b7e2-49ff-b272-9feef61e5ae8" />
- I added all my chrome passwords to this password manager by exporting them from the chrome password manager.
<img width="1688" height="999" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 200533" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6b2f2b-8836-48b4-9c57-d7b133033db8" />
- Bitwarden is end-to-end encrypted, is open source. Bitwarden is also compatible accross multiple platforms.
- Password managers are made to securely store your passwords, usernames, etc. Password managers can also generate you strong passwords that are not easy to hack, as most people like to keep the same passwords they remember easily, but those same passwords are then also easy for the hackers to guess. 
- Attacks such as credential stuffing where hackers use the same password and username they already got to breach into your other sites. This is made easy by having the same password and username for almost every site.

## s)

- So cracking the ciphertext.
- This challenge was quite difficult at first because I didnt really understand how to decipher the text but I then started trying some simple tricks.
<img width="1472" height="635" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 204551" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a33a30a3-c96a-4fed-8602-f3b461899d00" />
- at the end of the text there was dhhp which i could pretty easily decipher into http. So that already gave me quite a nice boost. I guessed that "I" would be "E" as it was quite a common letter to be found
<img width="1412" height="683" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 204633" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54833b91-e93e-4187-8e26-160e1845d49d" />
- Then i guessed that "M" was "A"
<img width="1425" height="725" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 204738" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7009b726-6d76-4be8-8d27-1c52916f3a2b" />
- After that I guessed that the first word would be "that's" which it clearly was. That already help me a lot in guessing the rest.
<img width="1415" height="659" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 204814" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36fbbaa6-5f2b-482f-b9e6-d24417eb0bbe" />
- Then I guessed that "B" would "s" because what other word ends in "ee" than "see"
<img width="1429" height="759" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 205020" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4436e710-5243-4020-99c7-26f5d7045d40" />
- Next was the letters "KWU" which I guessed meant "you"
<img width="1552" height="726" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 205210" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f41225d-f4c9-475e-8d65-c76fb501a185" />
- At this point I already had the start more or less figured out as "That's it. You're..."
<img width="1445" height="762" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 205438" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e706579e-406b-437d-90ef-371722c9aafc" />
- After this point I just started guessing what letters could start going where since I had almost all the most common letters.
<img width="1560" height="774" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 205647" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c26d9a71-7bec-49f6-8075-47cd484e52be" />
<img width="1429" height="695" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 205706" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abec2554-572b-426a-9d7b-2c0d1e05e9d1" />
- To finish I got this text in the picture below.
<img width="1450" height="632" alt="Näyttökuva 2025-09-21 210105" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1adfc974-668c-4e4c-90ca-50c9fa5524d9" />
