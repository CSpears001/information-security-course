- It is the idea of sending messages to another person without a third person or eavesdropper accessing that message in any way before the receiver.
- These messages are laid out in plaintext.
- Ciphertext is an encrypted message.
- Encryption is what makes plaintext into ciphertext
- The way of keeping messages secure is cryptography which is done by cryptographers.
- The art of breaking ciphertext is cryptanalysis which is done by cyptoanalysts.
- Authentication is the verification of the senders own indentity.
- Integrity means that the message should be the original one sent by the sender to the receiver and that has not been tampered with.
- Nonrepudiation means that the sender cant later falsely deny that he ever sent the message.
- There are two types of key-based algorithms. These being public-key and symmetric.
- In symmetric algorithms both the sender and the receiver share the same key.
- In a public-key algorithm you have a key pair, the public and private ones.
- Steganography is made to hide messages within other messages.
- Substitution ciphers are made to hide a message by replacing characters with other ones.
- Tranposition ciphers hide a message by mixing the order of the characters in the message.
- XOR seems to be quite easy to break since you can use plaintext ⊕ key = ciphertext but you can reverse this to be ciphertext ⊕ key = plaintext so it is really easy to decrypt a message if I understood correctly.
- One-Time Pads are a way of encrypting messages very securely. It creates truly random keys that are used once and then destroyed.

- PGP using gpg is a way of encrypting and signing messages.
- You need to generate a key pair. Public and secret.
- You need to send the public key to the person who wants to send you a message before they can send it.
- You need to verify that the public key is actual the public key of the person you want to send a message to.
- If now you want to send a message to another person you need their public key.
