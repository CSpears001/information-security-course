- It is the idea of sending messages to another person without a third person or eavesdropper accessing that message in any way before the receiver.
- These messages are laid out in plaintext.
- Ciphertext is an encrypted message.
- Encryption is what makes plaintext into ciphertext
- The way of keeping messages secure is cryptography which is done by cryptographers.
- The art of breaking ciphertext is cryptanalysis which is done by cyptoanalysts.
- Authentication is the verification of the senders own indentity.
- Integrity means that the message should be the original one sent by the sender to the receiver and that has not been tampered with.
- Nonrepudiation means that the sender cant later falsely deny that he ever sent the message.
- There are two types of key-based algorithms. These being public-key and symmetric.
- In symmetric algorithms both the sender and the receiver share the same key.
- In a public-key algorithm you have a key pair, the public and private ones.
- Steganography is made to hide messages within other messages.
- Substitution ciphers are made to hide a message by replacing characters with other ones.
- Tranposition ciphers hide a message by mixing the order of the characters in the message.
- XOR seems to be quite easy to break since you can use plaintext ⊕ key = ciphertext but you can reverse this to be ciphertext ⊕ key = plaintext so it is really easy to decrypt a message if I understood correctly.
- One-Time Pads are a way of encrypting messages very securely. It creates truly random keys that are used once and then destroyed.

- PGP using gpg is a way of encrypting and signing messages.
- You need to generate a key pair. Public and secret.
- You need to send the public key to the person who wants to send you a message before they can send it.
- You need to verify that the public key is actual the public key of the person you want to send a message to.
- If now you want to send a message to another person you need their public key.

## a) 

- I started by opening terminal and first updating the linux with the command sudo apt-get update

- After updating the linux I went and started downloading the ssh onto my linux with the command sudo apt-get install ssh

- After installing the ssh I started it with the command sudo systemctl start ssh

- After this I gave the command whoami to find my localhost
- After that I gave the command ssh chris@localhost to the terminal
<img width="880" height="181" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175444" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ef59b2-fdb9-485b-87de-097f62552d3f" />
<img width="914" height="447" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 175502" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd14d4c1-69f0-4065-9e94-3dc47a4020bb" />
- I typed yes for both questions when they came up.
- After this I exited

## b)

- I opened the ssh again with the command ssh chris@localhost
- After this I gave the command ssh-keygen
<img width="1001" height="456" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180504" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dba56f1-2940-4167-96fd-0368cd22e707" />
- It will ask you to give a passphrase but I just pressed enter to bypass that so that there is no passphrase. you need to press enter twice as it asks for it a second time.
- After that it gave me the key.
- Then after that I gave the command ssh-copy-id chris@localhost to give the public key to the ssh
<img width="1134" height="245" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-21 180811" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/799cb7fb-fc36-4a4d-95c4-def30986c22e" />
- After that I exited and tried the command ssh chris@localhost and this time the ssh did not ask for my password anymore.
