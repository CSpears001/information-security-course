- The NSA so National Security Agency of the USA still has not been able to break into the anonyminity that Tor provides.
- They have been able to compromise users but not the actual Tor.
- Tor is not only used by criminals. It can be used by for example activists who circumvent their nations censorships to provide information ananonymously.
- Tor is open source and does not have a military backdoor like some think.
- Tor is easy to use. You can download the Tor Browser Bundle to your computer and run it through for example your terminal in Linux.
- Tor is not an interely fool proof way of anonyminity. If you use Tor incorrectly you can leak your information. So keep software up to date and you probably shouldnt expose your real identity there anyways.

- Tor is a browser that is based on Firefox. It is meant to give users anonyminity and privacy by hiding their IP addresses. This is made through three random relays. The entry, middle, and exit.
- Tor was made by the US government in 2002 but is not currently under their control.
- The Tor browser is very easy to use as it really is just a simplified version of Firefox.
- The biggest weakness when trying to find criminals within Tor is actually the user themself.
- Tails is a operating system that can be used anonymously.
- Tails is based on Debian/Linyx and can be run off DVD, USB, or SD cards and it doesn't need to be installed directly onto your computer.
- Many of the illegal markets you can think of are being run right now in Tor but they are quite hard to track down.
