### Quintin
- The NSA so National Security Agency of the USA still has not been able to break into the anonyminity that Tor provides.
- They have been able to compromise users but not the actual Tor.
- Tor is not only used by criminals. It can be used by for example activists who circumvent their nations censorships to provide information ananonymously.
- Tor is open source and does not have a military backdoor like some think.
- Tor is easy to use. You can download the Tor Browser Bundle to your computer and run it through for example your terminal in Linux.
- Tor is not an interely fool proof way of anonyminity. If you use Tor incorrectly you can leak your information. So keep software up to date and you probably shouldnt expose your real identity there anyways.

### Shavers & Bair
- Tor is a browser that is based on Firefox. It is meant to give users anonyminity and privacy by hiding their IP addresses. This is made through three random relays. The entry, middle, and exit.
- Tor was made by the US government in 2002 but is not currently under their control.
- The Tor browser is very easy to use as it really is just a simplified version of Firefox.
- The biggest weakness when trying to find criminals within Tor is actually the user themself.
- Tails is a operating system that can be used anonymously.
- Tails is based on Debian/Linyx and can be run off DVD, USB, or SD cards and it doesn't need to be installed directly onto your computer.
- Many of the illegal markets you can think of are being run right now in Tor but they are quite hard to track down.

## a) 
- First I started up my Linux. Then went into terminal where I updated my system with the Command Sudo apt-get update

- After this I gave the command sudo apt-get install tor and pressed tab because I couldnt remember the end bit

- After finding the right name I gave it the command sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher

- We had already installed tor in the last lesson so it just checked that everything was up to date
- After this I launched the tor browser with the command torbrowser-launcher

- After this I searched for the Ahmia search engine which we used in the last lesson
<img width="887" height="497" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 183800" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a6fc1ac-68ac-425b-bac9-8c4448e954ce" />
<img width="1227" height="737" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 181445" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74296fd-8ea5-4780-97ee-163581a05589" />
- After opening the browser you should go to the top right of the screen and press the purple .onion available to access the onion version of Ahmia

## b)

- Now that I have access to Tor and to the actual browser I first searched for some forums on the Ahmia search engine that I showed how to access in the last exercise.
<img width="1248" height="641" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 181918" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ffb37f2-3fdf-48d4-834e-1c7f9ad4aa53" />
- This is the forum that I chose to look at. It is called DarkNetArmy
<img width="1278" height="755" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 182810" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/437b8f99-f9ee-4926-82d4-63061387e0d4" />
- The forum just had some scammer alerts and some leaked accounts for Spotify and such, but who knows if they are real anyways.
- Next I searched for a marketplace and selected the first link which led me to a website called venus marketplace.
<img width="1226" height="641" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 183440" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38419f9c-45ee-4669-8f9f-0a714f4113f1" />
- This marketplace had all kinds of things for sale such as iPhones or MacBooks to drugs like cocaine
<img width="1222" height="617" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 183625" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37b0681d-0dda-461c-a922-023c9d8fb163" />
<img width="1187" height="613" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 183613" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e9866e-4e2f-4725-9258-d8c0ec896616" />
- I tried finding Amazon on Ahmia but this was the only thing kind of close to it that I could find. Of course this is also a market for things like drugs.
<img width="1149" height="683" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 184400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1518c580-eeb1-48d4-902e-8ff4915cde6c" />
- If you try through DuckDuckGo on Tor you could actual find Amazon but this isnt a .onion site its just a normal website.
